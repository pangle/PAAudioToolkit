# PAAudioToolkit
`PAAudioToolkit` is a standalone class to facilitate importing `MPMediaItem`s from a users iOS Media Library as files for use in your applications for situations when simply playing the audio using the `AVAudioPlayer` framework is not enough.

**Important Note:**
`PAAudioToolkit` can only import DRM-free items that are stored on the users device and are not part of Apple Music.
